Project Approach Reflection:
Approach: I began by researching similar websites and their functionalities to understand key requirements and user interactions. This gave me a clear sense of the project's scope and expectations. After that, I broke down the functionality into five core modules:

Creating a GUI interface or window using tkinter
Adding an image upload button
Creating a label component for displaying and editing text
Handling image uploads, resizing, and display using the Pillow library (PIL)
Integrating label manipulation features for dynamic updates based on user input
Challenges: The most difficult part was working with tkinter and Pillow to upload and manipulate images. While tkinter handles the GUI and user interactions, managing image processing required learning the Pillow library functions, such as loading images (Image.open()), resizing (Image.resize()), and converting the image format for tkinter compatibility (ImageTk.PhotoImage()). Understanding how to bridge these two libraries for smooth image handling took extra effort, especially in terms of image scaling and maintaining quality.

Easier Aspects: Understanding the project requirements was straightforward, and breaking down the functionality into smaller modules made it easier to handle. Once I divided the tasks, such as creating the GUI and setting up the upload button, it became clearer how each part would work together. Using Pillow also simplified image processing once I got the hang of the core functions.

Improvements for Next Time: Next time, I would approach the project by starting with a simpler structure. I could begin by setting up basic image upload and display features and then gradually add more complex image manipulation like resizing and applying filters. This would streamline the process and avoid unnecessary complications early on.

Key Learning: My biggest takeaway was the importance of breaking the project down into smaller, manageable modules. Additionally, I learned the value of using libraries like Pillow for image processing, which offers easy-to-use functions for opening, editing, and displaying images. Combining Pillow with tkinter efficiently handled both the GUI and image-related tasks.

What I'd Do Differently: If I were to tackle this project again, I would write more concise and modular code. I would also ensure that image handling was done in a more efficient way, possibly by caching images to reduce processing time. I would spend more time experimenting with additional Pillow functions like cropping or applying filters (Image.filter()) to enhance functionality. Moreover, I would consider exploring alternative libraries to tkinter that might offer smoother integration with image processing tools.
